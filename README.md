## Feature scalling 
the process to scale the input feature for a model. Feature scalling may occure through two things  
#### Standardization and Normalization
### 1
### Normalization  
Normalization is a scaling technique in which values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging between 0 and 1. It is also known as Min-Max scaling.
### 2
#### Standardization 
is another scaling technique where the values are centered around the mean with a unit standard deviation. This means that the mean of the attribute becomes zero and the resultant distribution has a unit standard deviation. (ie) in which mean is 0 and standard devation is 1.
The standard deviation is a statistic that measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean. It is calculated as the square root of variance
